// TODO - Full path (starting from root) to the files containing all our SQL queries.

Pulled from requirement:
PleaseincludeaTeamInfo.txtfile in the root directory of your project indicating which file/files contains the SQL implemented by your project. 
If your SQL queries are spread across >10 files, you should place your SQL queriesin a single file.  
The grading TA will want to look at your SQL, and it will be much easier for us to find if you tell us which file(s) that’s located in!
MAKE SURE you have pushed your changes to GitHub, not merely committed locally. We need to be able to inspect your code. 
If you are unsure how to get the commit ID, one way is to go into your project directory and type “git log”.
